• Account for multi-key tables

•	Make improvements to how the options for functions are used (ini file? bit enumerated constants?infinite number of params?)

•	Introduce some kind of file auto-updater -- you run this manually, and it somehow manages to non-destructively update your code
•	incorporate it into the web starter

•	Introduce some kind of way of adding per-field-options --> which would need to be handled by a function within the Table.php file
