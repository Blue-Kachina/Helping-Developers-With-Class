• Try to move the Save() and Load() into the GeneratedClass.php -- will require some modifications (store tablename in class etc...) -->This will make updates much easier!
• Move "protected $fields_excluded_locally = array();" under the line
• Create a simple Save() and Load() function in the generated file -- they will simply just call the parent function though
• Account for multi-key tables

•	Make improvements to how the options for functions are used (ini file? bit enumerated constants?infinite number of params?)

•	Introduce some kind of file auto-updater -- you run this manually, and it somehow manages to non-destructively update your code
•	incorporate it into the web starter

•	Introduce some kind of way of adding per-field-options --> which would need to be handled by a function within the Table.php file
