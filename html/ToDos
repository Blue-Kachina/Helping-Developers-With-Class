• Account for multi-key tables
• Implement a find function ie Bool function FindRecordsInThisTable($nameValuePairs, &$findResults)

•	Make improvements to how the options for functions are used (ini file? bit enumerated constants?infinite number of params?)

•	Introduce some kind of file auto-updater -- you run this manually, and it somehow manages to non-destructively update your code

•	Introduce some kind of way of adding per-field-options --> which would need to be handled by a function within the Table.php file
